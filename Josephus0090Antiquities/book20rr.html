<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">1</div>
<p>Upon the death of king Agrippa, which we have related in the foregoing book, Claudius Cæsar sent Cassius Longinus as successor to Marcus, out of regard to the memory of king Agrippa, who had often desired of him by letters, while he was alive, that he would not suffer Marcus to be any longer president of Syria.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But Fadus, as soon as he was come procurator into Judea, found quarrelsome doings between the Jews that dwelt in Perea, and the people of Philadelphia, about their borders, at a village called Mia, that was filled with men of a warlike temper; for the Jews of Perea had taken up arms without the consent of their principal men, and had destroyed many of the Philadelphians.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Fadus was informed of this procedure, it provoked him very much that they had not left the determination of the matter to him, if they thought that the Philadelphians had done them any wrong, but had rashly taken up arms against them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So he seized upon three of their principal men, who were also the causes of this sedition, and ordered them to be bound, and afterwards had one of them slain, whose name was Hannibal; and he banished the other two, Areram and Eleazar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tholomy also, the arch robber, was, after some time, brought to him bound, and slain, but not till he had done a world of mischief to Idumea and the Arabians.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And indeed, from that time, Judea was cleared of robberies by the care and providence of Fadus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He also at this time sent for the high priests and the principal citizens of Jerusalem, and this at the command of the emperor, and admonished them that they should lay up the long garment and the sacred vestment, which it is customary for nobody but the high priest to wear, in the tower of Antonia, that it might be under the power of the Romans, as it had been formerly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now the Jews durst not contradict what he had said, but desired Fadus, however, and Longinus, [which last was come to Jerusalem, and had brought a great army with him, out of a fear that the [rigid] injunctions of Fadus should force the Jews to rebel,] that they might, in the first place, have leave to send ambassadors to Cæsar, to petition him that they may have the holy vestments under their own power; and that, in the next place, they would tarry till they knew what answer Claudius would give to that their request.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So they replied, that they would give them leave to send their ambassadors, provided they would give them their sons as pledges [for their peaceable behavior].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And when they had agreed so to do, and had given them the pledges they desired, the ambassadors were sent accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But when, upon their coming to Rome, Agrippa, junior, the son of the deceased, understood the reason why they came, [for he dwelt with Claudius Cæsar, as we said before,] he besought Cæsar to grant the Jews their request about the holy vestments, and to send a message to Fadus accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">2</div>
<p>Hereupon Claudius called for the ambassadors; and told them that he granted their request; and bade them to return their thanks to Agrippa for this favor, which had been bestowed on them upon his entreaty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And besides these answers of his, he sent the following letter by them: "Claudius Cæsar Germanicus, tribune of the people the fifth time, and designed consul the fourth time, and imperator the tenth time, the father of his country, to the magistrates, senate, and people, and the whole nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon the presentation of your ambassadors to me by Agrippa, my friend, whom I have brought up, and have now with me, and who is a person of very great piety, who are come to give me thanks for the care I have taken of your nation, and to entreat me, in an earnest and obliging manner, that they may have the holy vestments, with the crown belonging to them, under their power,--I grant their request, as that excellent person Vitellius, who is very dear to me, had done before me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And I have complied with your desire, in the first place, out of regard to that piety which I profess, and because I would have every one worship God according to the laws of their own country; and this I do also because I shall hereby highly gratify king Herod, and Agrippa, junior, whose sacred regards to me, and earnest good-will to you, I am well acquainted with, and with whom I have the greatest friendship, and whom I highly esteem, and look on as persons of the best character.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now I have written about these affairs to Cuspius Fadus, my procurator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The names of those that brought me your letter are Cornelius, the son of Cero, Trypho, the son of Theudio, Dorotheus, the son of Nathaniel, and John, the son of Jotre.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This letter is dated before the fourth of the calends of July, when Ruffis and Pompeius Sylvanus are consuls."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">3</div>
<p>Herod also, the brother of the deceased Agrippa, who was then possessed of the royal authority over Chalcis, petitioned Claudius Cæsar for the authority over the temple, and the money of the sacred treasure, and the choice of the high priests, and obtained all that he petitioned for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So that after that time this authority continued among all his descendants till the end of the war <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_1">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> Accordingly, Herod removed the last high priest, called Cimtheras, and bestowed that dignity on his successor Joseph, the son of Cantos.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_how_helena_the_queen_of_adiabene_and_her_son_izates_embraced_the_jewish_religion_and_how_helena_supplied_the_poor_with_corn_when_there_was_a_great_famine_at_jerusalem">2. How Helena The Queen Of Adiabene And Her Son Izates, Embraced The Jewish Religion; And How Helena Supplied The Poor With Corn, When There Was A Great Famine At Jerusalem.</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">1</div>
<p>About this time it was that Helena, queen of Adiabene, and her son Izates, changed their course of life, and embraced the Jewish customs, and this on the occasion following: Monobazus, the king of Adiabene, who had also the name of Bazeus, fell in love with his sister Helena, and took her to be his wife, and begat her with child.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But as he was in bed with her one night, he laid his hand upon his wife&#8217;s belly, and fell asleep, and seemed to hear a voice, which bid him take his hand off his wife&#8217;s belly, and not hurt the infant that was therein, which, by God&#8217;s providence, would be safely born, and have a happy end.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This voice put him into disorder; so he awaked immediately, and told the story to his wife; and when his son was born, he called him Izates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He had indeed Monobazus, his elder brother, by Helena also, as he had other sons by other wives besides.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yet did he openly place all his affections on this his only begotten <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_2">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup> son Izates, which was the origin of that envy which his other brethren, by the same father, bore to him; while on this account they hated him more and more, and were all under great affliction that their father should prefer Izates before them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now although their father was very sensible of these their passions, yet did he forgive them, as not indulging those passions out of an ill disposition, but out of a desire each of them had to be beloved by their father.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, he sent Izates, with many presents, to Abennerig, the king of Charax- Spasini, and that out of the great dread he was in about him, lest he should come to some misfortune by the hatred his brethren bore him; and he committed his son&#8217;s preservation to him.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon which Abennerig gladly received the young man, and had a great affection for him, and married him to his own daughter, whose name was Samacha: he also bestowed a country upon him, from which he received large revenues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">2</div>
<p>But when Monobazus was grown old, and saw that he had but a little time to live, he had a mind to come to the sight of his son before he died.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So he sent for him, and embraced him after the most affectionate manner, and bestowed on him the country called Carra; it was a soil that bare amomum in great plenty: there are also in it the remains of that ark, wherein it is related that Noah escaped the deluge, and where they are still shown to such as are desirous to see them <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_3">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accordingly, Izates abode in that country until his father&#8217;s death.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the very day that Monobazus died, queen Helena sent for all the grandees, and governors of the kingdom, and for those that had the armies committed to their command; and when they were come, she made the following speech to them: "I believe you are not unacquainted that my husband was desirous Izates should succeed him in the government, and thought him worthy so to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, I wait your determination; for happy is he who receives a kingdom, not from a single person only, but from the willing suffrages of a great many." This she said, in order to try those that were invited, and to discover their sentiments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon the hearing of which, they first of all paid their homage to the queen, as their custom was, and then they said that they confirmed the king&#8217;s determination, and would submit to it; and they rejoiced that Izates&#8217;s father had preferred him before the rest of his brethren, as being agreeable to all their wishes: but that they were desirous first of all to slay his brethren and kinsmen, that so the government might come securely to Izates; because if they were once destroyed, all that fear would be over which might arise from their hatred and envy to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Helena replied to this, that she returned them her thanks for their kindness to herself and to Izates; but desired that they would however defer the execution of this slaughter of Izates&#8217;s brethren till he should be there himself, and give his approbation to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So since these men had not prevailed with her, when they advised her to slay them, they exhorted her at least to keep them in bonds till he should come, and that for their own security; they also gave her counsel to set up some one whom she could put the greatest trust in, as a governor of the kingdom in the mean time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So queen Helena complied with this counsel of theirs, and set up Monobazus, the eldest son, to be king, and put the diadem upon his head, and gave him his father&#8217;s ring, with its signet; as also the ornament which they call Sampser, and exhorted him to administer the affairs of the kingdom till his brother should come; who came suddenly upon hearing that his father was dead, and succeeded his brother Monobazus, who resigned up the government to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">3</div>
<p>Now, during the time Izates abode at Charax-Spasini, a certain Jewish merchant, whose name was Ananias, got among the women that belonged to the king, and taught them to worship God according to the Jewish religion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He, moreover, by their means, became known to Izates, and persuaded him, in like manner, to embrace that religion; he also, at the earnest entreaty of Izates, accompanied him when he was sent for by his father to come to Adiabene; it also happened that Helena, about the same time, was instructed by a certain other Jew and went over to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But when Izates had taken the kingdom, and was come to Adiabene, and there saw his brethren and other kinsmen in bonds, he was displeased at it; and as he thought it an instance of impiety either to slay or imprison them, but still thought it a hazardous thing for to let them have their liberty, with the remembrance of the injuries that had been offered them, he sent some of them and their children for hostages to Rome, to Claudius Cæsar, and sent the others to Artabanus, the king of Parthia, with the like intentions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">4</div>
<p>And when he perceived that his mother was highly pleased with the Jewish customs, he made haste to change, and to embrace them entirely; and as he supposed that he could not be thoroughly a Jew unless he were circumcised, he was ready to have it done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But when his mother understood what he was about, she endeavored to hinder him from doing it, and said to him that this thing would bring him into danger; and that, as he was a king, he would thereby bring himself into great odium among his subjects, when they should understand that he was so fond of rites that were to them strange and foreign; and that they would never bear to be ruled over by a Jew.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This it was that she said to him, and for the present persuaded him to forbear.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And when he had related what she had said to Ananias, he confirmed what his mother had said; and when he had also threatened to leave him, unless he complied with him, he went away from him, and said that he was afraid lest such an action being once become public to all, he should himself be in danger of punishment for having been the occasion of it, and having been the king&#8217;s instructor in actions that were of ill reputation; and he said that he might worship God without being circumcised, even though he did resolve to follow the Jewish law entirely, which worship of God was of a superior nature to circumcision.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He added, that God would forgive him, though he did not perform the operation, while it was omitted out of necessity, and for fear of his subjects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the king at that time complied with these persuasions of Ananias.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But afterwards, as he had not quite left off his desire of doing this thing, a certain other Jew that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar, and who was esteemed very skillful in the learning of his country, persuaded him to do the thing; for as he entered into his palace to salute him, and found him reading the law of Moses, he said to him, "Thou dost not consider, O king! that thou unjustly breakest the principal of those laws, and art injurious to God himself, [by omitting to be circumcised]; for thou oughtest not only to read them, but chiefly to practice what they enjoin thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How long wilt thou continue uncircumcised? But if thou hast not yet read the law about circumcision, and dost not know how great impiety thou art guilty of by neglecting it, read it now." When the king had heard what he said, he delayed the thing no longer, but retired to another room, and sent for a surgeon, and did what he was commanded to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He then sent for his mother, and Ananias his tutor, and informed them that he had done the thing; upon which they were presently struck with astonishment and fear, and that to a great degree, lest the thing should be openly discovered and censured, and the king should hazard the loss of his kingdom, while his subjects would not bear to be governed by a man who was so zealous in another religion; and lest they should themselves run some hazard, because they would be supposed the occasion of his so doing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But it was God himself who hindered what they feared from taking effect; for he preserved both Izates himself and his sons when they fell into many dangers, and procured their deliverance when it seemed to be impossible, and demonstrated thereby that the fruit of piety does not perish as to those that have regard to him, and fix their faith upon him only <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_4">[<a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But these events we shall relate hereafter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">5</div>
<p>But as to Helena, the king&#8217;s mother, when she saw that the affairs of Izates&#8217;s kingdom were in peace, and that her son was a happy man, and admired among all men, and even among foreigners, by the means of God&#8217;s providence over him, she had a mind to go to the city of Jerusalem, in order to worship at that temple of God which was so very famous among all men, and to offer her thank-offerings there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So she desired her son to give her leave to go thither; upon which he gave his consent to what she desired very willingly, and made great preparations for her dismission, and gave her a great deal of money, and she went down to the city Jerusalem, her son conducting her on her journey a great way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now her coming was of very great advantage to the people of Jerusalem; for whereas a famine did oppress them at that time, and many people died for want of what was necessary to procure food withal, queen Helena sent some of her servants to Alexandria with money to buy a great quantity of corn, and others of them to Cyprus, to bring a cargo of dried figs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And as soon as they were come back, and had brought those provisions, which was done very quickly, she distributed food to those that were in want of it, and left a most excellent memorial behind her of this benefaction, which she bestowed on our whole nation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And when her son Izates was informed of this famine, <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_5">[<a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_5" title="View footnote.">5</a>]</sup> he sent great sums of money to the principal men in Jerusalem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, what favors this queen and king conferred upon our city Jerusalem shall be further related hereafter.</p>

How Artabanus, the King of Parthia out of Fear of the Secret Contrivances of His Subjects Against Him, Went to Izates, and Was By Him Reinstated in His Government; as Also How Bardanes His Son Denounced War Against Izates.</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">1</div>
<p>But now Artabanus, king of the Parthians perceiving that the governors of the provinces had framed a plot against him, did not think it safe for him to continue among them; but resolved to go to Izates, in hopes of finding some way for his preservation by his means, and, if possible, for his return to his own dominions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So he came to Izates, and brought a thousand of his kindred and servants with him, and met him upon the road, while he well knew Izates, but Izates did not know him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Artabanus stood near him, and, in the first place, worshipped him, according to the custom, he then said to him, "O king! do not thou overlook me thy servant, nor do thou proudly reject the suit I make thee; for as I am reduced to a low estate, by the change of fortune, and of a king am become a private man, I stand in need of thy assistance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Have regard, therefore, unto the uncertainty of fortune, and esteem the care thou shalt take of me to be taken of thyself also; for if I be neglected, and my subjects go off unpunished, many other subjects will become the more insolent towards other kings also." And this speech Artabanus made with tears in his eyes, and with a dejected countenance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now as soon as Izates heard Artabanus&#8217;s name, and saw him stand as a supplicant before him, he leaped down from his horse immediately, and said to him, "Take courage, O king! nor be disturbed at thy present calamity, as if it were incurable; for the change of thy sad condition shall be sudden; for thou shalt find me to be more thy friend and thy assistant than thy hopes can promise thee; for I will either re- establish thee in the kingdom of Parthia, or lose my own."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">2</div>
<p>When he had said this, he set Artabanus upon his horse, and followed him on foot, in honor of a king whom he owned as greater than himself; which, when Artabanus saw, he was very uneasy at it, and sware by his present fortune and honor that he would get down from his horse, unless Izates would get upon his horse again, and go before him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So he complied with his desire, and leaped upon his horse; and when he had brought him to his royal palace, he showed him all sorts of respect when they sat together, and he gave him the upper place at festivals also, as regarding not his present fortune, but his former dignity, and that upon this consideration also, that the changes of fortune are common to all men.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He also wrote to the Parthians, to persuade them to receive Artabanus again; and gave them his right hand and his faith, that he should forget what was past and done, and that he would undertake for this as a mediator between them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now the Parthians did not themselves refuse to receive him again, but pleaded that it was not now in their power so to do, because they had committed the government to another person, who had accepted of it, and whose name was Cinnamus; and that they were afraid lest a civil war should arise on this account.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Cinnamus understood their intentions, he wrote to Artabanus himself, for he had been brought up by him, and was of a nature good and gentle also, and desired him to put confidence in him, and to come and take his own dominions again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accordingly, Artabanus trusted him, and returned home; when Cinnamus met him, worshipped him, and saluted him as a king, and took the diadem off his own head, and put it on the head of Artabanus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">3</div>
<p>And thus was Artahanus restored to his kingdom again by the means of Izates, when he had lost it by the means of the grandees of the kingdom.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nor was he unmindful of the benefits he had conferred upon him, but rewarded him with such honors as were of the greatest esteem among them; for he gave him leave to wear his tiara upright, <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_6">[<a id="_footnoteref_6" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_6" title="View footnote.">6</a>]</sup> and to sleep upon a golden bed, which are privileges and marks of honor peculiar to the kings of Parthia.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He also cut off a large and fruitful country from the king of Armenia, and bestowed it upon him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The name of the country is Nisibis, wherein the Macedonians had formerly built that city which they called Antioch of Mygodonia.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And these were the honors that were paid Izates by the king of the Parthians.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">4</div>
<p>But in no long time Artabanus died, and left his kingdom to his son Bardanes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now this Bardanes came to Izates, and would have persuaded him to join him with his army, and to assist him in the war he was preparing to make with the Romans; but he could not prevail with him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For Izates so well knew the strength and good fortune of the Romans, that he took Bardanes to attempt what was impossible to be done; and having besides sent his sons, five in number, and they but young also, to learn accurately the language of our nation, together with our learning, as well as he had sent his mother to worship at our temple, as I have said already, was the more backward to a compliance; and restrained Bardanes, telling him perpetually of the great armies and famous actions of the Romans, and thought thereby to terrify him, and desired thereby to hinder him from that expedition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the Parthian king was provoked at this his behavior, and denounced war immediately against Izates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yet did he gain no advantage by this war, because God cut off all his hopes therein; for the Parthians perceiving Bardanes&#8217;s intentions, and how he had determined to make war with the Romans, slew him, and gave his kingdom to his brother Gotarzes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He also, in no long time, perished by a plot made against him, and Vologases, his brother, succeeded him, who committed two of his provinces to two of his brothers by the same father; that of the Medes to the elder, Pacorus; and Armenia to the younger, Tiridates.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_how_izates_was_betrayed_by_his_own_subjects_and_fought_against_by_the_arabians_and_how_izates_by_the_providence_of_god_was_delivered_out_of_their_hands">4. How Izates Was Betrayed By His Own Subjects, And Fought Against By The Arabians And How Izates, By The Providence Of God, Was Delivered Out Of Their Hands.</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">1</div>
<p>Now when the king&#8217;s brother, Monobazus, and his other kindred, saw how Izates, by his piety to God, was become greatly esteemed by all men, they also had a desire to leave the religion of their country, and to embrace the customs of the Jews; but that act of theirs was discovered by Izates&#8217;s subjects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whereupon the grandees were much displeased, and could not contain their anger at them; but had an intention, when they should find a proper opportunity, to inflict a punishment upon them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accordingly, they wrote to Abia, king of the Arabians, and promised him great sums of money, if he would make an expedition against their king; and they further promised him, that, on the first onset, they would desert their king, because they were desirous to punish him, by reason of the hatred he had to their religious worship; then they obliged themselves, by oaths, to be faithful to each other, and desired that he would make haste in this design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The king of Arabia complied with their desires, and brought a great army into the field, and marched against Izates; and, in the beginning of the first onset, and before they came to a close fight, those grandees, as if they had a panic terror upon them, all deserted Izates, as they had agreed to do, and, turning their backs upon their enemies, ran away.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yet was not Izates dismayed at this; but when he understood that the grandees had betrayed him, he also retired into his camp, and made inquiry into the matter; and as soon as he knew who they were that made this conspiracy with the king of Arabia, he cut off those that were found guilty; and renewing the fight on the next day, he slew the greatest part of his enemies, and forced all the rest to betake themselves to flight.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He also pursued their king, and drove him into a fortress called Arsamus, and following on the siege vigorously, he took that fortress.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And when he had plundered it of all the prey that was in it, which was not small, he returned to Adiabene; yet did not he take Abia alive, because, when he found himself encompassed on every side, he slew himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">2</div>
<p>But although the grandees of Adiabene had failed in their first attempt, as being delivered up by God into their king&#8217;s hands, yet would they not even then be quiet, but wrote again to Vologases, who was then king of Parthia, and desired that he would kill Izates, and set over them some other potentate, who should be of a Parthian family; for they said that they hated their own king for abrogating the laws of their forefathers, and embracing foreign customs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the king of Parthia heard this, he boldly made war upon Izates; and as he had no just pretense for this war, he sent to him, and demanded back those honorable privileges which had been bestowed on him by his father, and threatened, on his refusal, to make war upon him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon hearing of this, Izates was under no small trouble of mind, as thinking it would be a reproach upon him to appear to resign those privileges that had been bestowed upon him out of cowardice; yet because he knew, that though the king of Parthia should receive back those honors, yet would he not be quiet, he resolved to commit himself to God, his Protector, in the present danger he was in of his life; and as he esteemed him to be his principal assistant, he intrusted his children and his wives to a very strong fortress, and laid up his corn in his citadels, and set the hay and the grass on fire.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And when he had thus put things in order, as well as he could, he awaited the coming of the enemy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And when the king of Parthia was come, with a great army of footmen and horsemen, which he did sooner than was expected, [for he marched in great haste,] and had cast up a bank at the river that parted Adiabene from Media,--Izates also pitched his camp not far off, having with him six thousand horsemen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But there came a messenger to Izates, sent by the king of Parthia, who told him how large his dominions were, as reaching from the river Euphrates to Bactria, and enumerated that king&#8217;s subjects; he also threatened him that he should be punished, as a person ungrateful to his lords; and said that the God whom he worshipped could not deliver him out of the king&#8217;s hands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the messenger had delivered this his message, Izates replied that he knew the king of Parthia&#8217;s power was much greater than his own; but that he knew also that God was much more powerful than all men.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And when he had returned him this answer, he betook himself to make supplication to God, and threw himself upon the ground, and put ashes upon his head, in testimony of his confusion, and fasted, together with his wives and children <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_7">[<a id="_footnoteref_7" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_7" title="View footnote.">7</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then he called upon God, and said, "O Lord and Governor, if I have not in vain committed myself to thy goodness, but have justly determined that thou only art the Lord and principal of all beings, come now to my assistance, and defend me from my enemies, not only on my own account, but on account of their insolent behavior with regard to thy power, while they have not feared to lift up their proud and arrogant tongue against thee." Thus did he lament and bemoan himself, with tears in his eyes; whereupon God heard his prayer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And immediately that very night Vologases received letters, the contents of which were these, that a great band of Dahe and Sacse, despising him, now he was gone so long a journey from home, had made an expedition, and laid Parthia waste; so that he [was forced to] retire back, without doing any thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And thus it was that Izates escaped the threatenings of the Parthians, by the providence of God.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">3</div>
<p>It was not long ere Izates died, when he had completed fifty-five years of his life, and had ruled his kingdom twenty-four years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He left behind him twenty-four sons and twenty-four daughters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, he gave order that his brother Monobazus should succeed in the government, thereby requiting him, because, while he was himself absent after their father&#8217;s death, he had faithfully preserved the government for him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But when Helena, his mother, heard of her son&#8217;s death, she was in great heaviness, as was but natural, upon her loss of such a most dutiful son; yet was it a comfort to her that she heard the succession came to her eldest son.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accordingly, she went to him in haste; and when she was come into Adiabene, she did not long outlive her son Izates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But Monobazus sent her bones, as well as those of Izates, his brother, to Jerusalem, and gave order that they should be buried at the pyramids <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_8">[<a id="_footnoteref_8" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_8" title="View footnote.">8</a>]</sup> which their mother had erected; they were three in number, and distant no more than three furlongs from the city Jerusalem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But for the actions of Monobazus the king, which he did during the rest of his life, we will relate them hereafter.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">1</div>
<p>Now it came to pass, while Fadus was procurator of Judea, that a certain magician, whose name was Theudas, <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_9">[<a id="_footnoteref_9" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_9" title="View footnote.">9</a>]</sup> persuaded a great part of the people to take their effects with them, and follow him to the river Jordan; for he told them he was a prophet, and that he would, by his own command, divide the river, and afford them an easy passage over it; and many were deluded by his words.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, Fadus did not permit them to make any advantage of his wild attempt, but sent a troop of horsemen out against them; who, falling upon them unexpectedly, slew many of them, and took many of them alive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They also took Theudas alive, and cut off his head, and carried it to Jerusalem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This was what befell the Jews in the time of Cuspius Fadus&#8217;s government.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">2</div>
<p>Then came Tiberius Alexander as successor to Fadus; he was the son of Alexander the alabarch of Alexandria, which Alexander was a principal person among all his contemporaries, both for his family and wealth: he was also more eminent for his piety than this his son Alexander, for he did not continue in the religion of his country.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Under these procurators that great famine happened in Judea, in which queen Helena bought corn in Egypt at a great expense, and distributed it to those that were in want, as I have related already.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And besides this, the sons of Judas of Galilee were now slain; I mean of that Judas who caused the people to revolt, when Cyrenius came to take an account of the estates of the Jews, as we have showed in a foregoing book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The names of those sons were James and Simon, whom Alexander commanded to be crucified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But now Herod, king of Chalcis, removed Joseph, the son of Camydus, from the high priesthood, and made Ananias, the son of Nebedeu, his successor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And now it was that Cumanus came as successor to Tiberius Alexander; as also that Herod, brother of Agrippa the great king, departed this life, in the eighth year of the reign of Claudius Cæsar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He left behind him three sons; Aristobulus, whom he had by his first wife, with Bernicianus, and Hyrcanus, both whom he had by Bernice his brother&#8217;s daughter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But Claudius Cæsar bestowed his dominions on Agrippa, junior.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">3</div>
<p>Now while the Jewish affairs were under the administration of Cumanus, there happened a great tumult at the city of Jerusalem, and many of the Jews perished therein.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But I shall first explain the occasion whence it was derived.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When that feast which is called the passover was at hand, at which time our custom is to use unleavened bread, and a great multitude was gathered together from all parts to that feast, Cumanus was afraid lest some attempt of innovation should then be made by them; so he ordered that one regiment of the army should take their arms, and stand in the temple cloisters, to repress any attempts of innovation, if perchance any such should begin; and this was no more than what the former procurators of Judea did at such festivals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But on the fourth day of the feast, a certain soldier let down his breeches, and exposed his privy members to the multitude, which put those that saw him into a furious rage, and made them cry out that this impious action was not done to approach them, but God himself; nay, some of them reproached Cumanus, and pretended that the soldier was set on by him, which, when Cumanus heard, he was also himself not a little provoked at such reproaches laid upon him; yet did he exhort them to leave off such seditious attempts, and not to raise a tumult at the festival.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But when he could not induce them to be quiet for they still went on in their reproaches to him, he gave order that the whole army should take their entire armor, and come to Antonia, which was a fortress, as we have said already, which overlooked the temple; but when the multitude saw the soldiers there, they were affrighted at them, and ran away hastily; but as the passages out were but narrow, and as they thought their enemies followed them, they were crowded together in their flight, and a great number were pressed to death in those narrow passages; nor indeed was the number fewer than twenty thousand that perished in this tumult.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So instead of a festival, they had at last a mournful day of it; and they all of them forgot their prayers and sacrifices, and betook themselves to lamentation and weeping; so great an affliction did the impudent obsceneness of a single soldier bring upon them <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_10">[<a id="_footnoteref_10" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_10" title="View footnote.">10</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">4</div>
<p>Now before this their first mourning was over, another mischief befell them also; for some of those that raised the foregoing tumult, when they were traveling along the public road, about a hundred furlongs from the city, robbed Stephanus, a servant of Cæsar, as he was journeying, and plundered him of all that he had with him; which things when Cumanus heard of, he sent soldiers immediately, and ordered them to plunder the neighboring villages, and to bring the most eminent persons among them in bonds to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now as this devastation was making, one of the soldiers seized the laws of Moses that lay in one of those villages, and brought them out before the eyes of all present, and tore them to pieces; and this was done with reproachful language, and much scurrility; which things when the Jews heard of, they ran together, and that in great numbers, and came down to Cæsarea, where Cumanus then was, and besought him that he would avenge, not themselves, but God himself, whose laws had been affronted; for that they could not bear to live any longer, if the laws of their forefathers must be affronted after this manner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accordingly Cumanus, out of fear lest the multitude should go into a sedition, and by the advice of his friends also, took care that the soldier who had offered the affront to the laws should be beheaded, and thereby put a stop to the sedition which was ready to be kindled a second time.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">1</div>
<p>Now there arose a quarrel between the Samaritans and the Jews on the occasion following: It was the custom of the Galileans, when they came to the holy city at the festivals, to take their journeys through the country of the Samaritans; <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_11">[<a id="_footnoteref_11" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_11" title="View footnote.">11</a>]</sup> and at this time there lay, in the road they took, a village that was called Ginea, which was situated in the limits of Samaria and the great plain, where certain persons thereto belonging fought with the Galileans, and killed a great many of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But when the principal of the Galileans were informed of what had been done, they came to Cumanus, and desired him to avenge the murder of those that were killed; but he was induced by the Samaritans, with money, to do nothing in the matter; upon which the Galileans were much displeased, and persuaded the multitude of the Jews to betake themselves to arms, and to regain their liberty, saying that slavery was in itself a bitter thing, but that when it was joined with direct injuries, it was perfectly intolerable, And when their principal men endeavored to pacify them, and promised to endeavor to persuade Cumanus to avenge those that were killed, they would not hearken to them, but took their weapons, and entreated the assistance of Eleazar, the son of Dineus, a robber, who had many years made his abode in the mountains, with which assistance they plundered many villages of the Samaritans.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Cumanus heard of this action of theirs, he took the band of Sebaste, with four regiments of footmen, and armed the Samaritans, and marched out against the Jews, and caught them, and slew many of them, and took a great number of them alive; whereupon those that were the most eminent persons at Jerusalem, and that both in regard to the respect that was paid them, and the families they were of, as soon as they saw to what a height things were gone, put on sackcloth, and heaped ashes upon their heads, and by all possible means besought the seditious, and persuaded them that they would set before their eyes the utter subversion of their country, the conflagration of their temple, and the slavery of themselves, their wives, and children, <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_12">[<a id="_footnoteref_12" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_12" title="View footnote.">12</a>]</sup> which would be the consequences of what they were doing; and would alter their minds, would cast away their weapons, and for the future be quiet, and return to their own homes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These persuasions of theirs prevailed upon them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the people dispersed themselves, and the robbers went away again to their places of strength; and after this time all Judea was overrun with robberies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">2</div>
<p>But the principal of the Samaritans went to Ummidius Quadratus, the president of Syria, who at that time was at Tyre, and accused the Jews of setting their villages on fire, and plundering them; and said withal, that they were not so much displeased at what they had suffered, as they were at the contempt thereby showed the Romans; while if they had received any injury, they ought to have made them the judges of what had been done, and not presently to make such devastation, as if they had not the Romans for their governors; on which account they came to him, in order to obtain that vengeance they wanted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This was the accusation which the Samaritans brought against the Jews.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the Jews affirmed that the Samaritans were the authors of this tumult and fighting, and that, in the first place, Cumanus had been corrupted by their gifts, and passed over the murder of those that were slain in silence;--which allegations when Quadratus heard, he put off the hearing of the cause, and promised that he would give sentence when he should come into Judea, and should have a more exact knowledge of the truth of that matter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So these men went away without success.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yet was it not long ere Quadratus came to Samaria, where, upon hearing the cause, he supposed that the Samaritans were the authors of that disturbance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But when he was informed that certain of the Jews were making innovations, he ordered those to be crucified whom Cumanus had taken captives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From whence he came to a certain village called Lydda, which was not less than a city in largeness, and there heard the Samaritan cause a second time before his tribunal, and there learned from a certain Samaritan that one of the chief of the Jews, whose name was Dortus, and some other innovators with him, four in number, persuaded the multitude to a revolt from the Romans; whom Quadratus ordered to be put to death: but still he sent away Ananias the high priest, and Ananus the commander [of the temple], in bonds to Rome, to give an account of what they had done to Claudius Cæsar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He also ordered the principal men, both of the Samaritans and of the Jews, as also Cumanus the procurator, and Celer the tribune, to go to Italy to the emperor, that he might hear their cause, and determine their differences one with another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But he came again to the city of Jerusalem, out of his fear that the multitude of the Jews should attempt some innovations; but he found the city in a peaceable state, and celebrating one of the usual festivals of their country to God.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So he believed that they would not attempt any innovations, and left them at the celebration of the festival, and returned to Antioch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">3</div>
<p>Now Cumanus, and the principal of the Samaritans, who were sent to Rome, had a day appointed them by the emperor whereon they were to have pleaded their cause about the quarrels they had one with another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But now Cæsar&#8217;s freed-men and his friends were very zealous on the behalf of Cumanus and the Samaritans; and they had prevailed over the Jews, unless Agrippa, junior, who was then at Rome, had seen the principal of the Jews hard set, and had earnestly entreated Agrippina, the emperor&#8217;s wife, to persuade her husband to hear the cause, so as was agreeable to his justice, and to condemn those to be punished who were really the authors of this revolt from the Roman government:--whereupon Claudius was so well disposed beforehand, that when he had heard the cause, and found that the Samaritans had been the ringleaders in those mischievous doings, he gave order that those who came up to him should be slain, and that Cumanus should be banished.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He also gave order that Celer the tribune should be carried back to Jerusalem, and should be drawn through the city in the sight of all the people, and then should be slain.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_felix_is_made_procurator_of_judea_as_also_concerning_agrippa_junior_and_his_sisters">7. Felix Is Made Procurator Of Judea; As Also Concerning Agrippa, Junior And His Sisters.</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">1</div>
<p>So Claudius sent Felix, the brother of Pallas, to take care of the affairs of Judea; and when he had already completed the twelfth year of his reign, he bestowed upon Agrippa the tetrarchy of Philip and Batanea, and added thereto Trachonites, with Abila; which last had been the tetrarchy of Lysanias; but he took from him Chalcis, when he had been governor thereof four years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And when Agrippa had received these countries as the gift of Cæsar, he gave his sister Drusilla in marriage to Azizus, king of Emesa, upon his consent to be circumcised; for Epiphanes, the son of king Antiochus, had refused to marry her, because, after he had promised her father formerly to come over to the Jewish religion, he would not now perform that promise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He also gave Mariamne in marriage to Archelaus, the son of Helcias, to whom she had formerly been betrothed by Agrippa her father; from which marriage was derived a daughter, whose name was Bernice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">2</div>
<p>But for the marriage of Drusilla with Azizus, it was in no long time afterward dissolved upon the following occasion: While Felix was procurator of Judea, he saw this Drusilla, and fell in love with her; for she did indeed exceed all other women in beauty; and he sent to her a person whose name was Simon <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_13">[<a id="_footnoteref_13" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_13" title="View footnote.">13</a>]</sup> one of his friends; a Jew he was, and by birth a Cypriot, and one who pretended to be a magician, and endeavored to persuade her to forsake her present husband, and marry him; and promised, that if she would not refuse him, he would make her a happy woman.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accordingly she acted ill, and because she was desirous to avoid her sister Bernice&#8217;s envy, for she was very ill treated by her on account of her beauty, was prevailed upon to transgress the laws of her forefathers, and to marry Felix; and when he had had a son by her, he named him Agrippa.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But after what manner that young man, with his wife, perished at the conflagration of the mountain Vesuvius, <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_14">[<a id="_footnoteref_14" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_14" title="View footnote.">14</a>]</sup> in the days of Titus Cæsar, shall be related hereafter <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_15">[<a id="_footnoteref_15" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_15" title="View footnote.">15</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">3</div>
<p>But as for Bernice, she lived a widow a long while after the death of Herod [king of Chalcis], who was both her husband and her uncle; but when the report went that she had criminal conversation with her brother, [Agrippa, junior,] she persuaded Poleme, who was king of Cilicia, to be circumcised, and to marry her, as supposing that by this means she should prove those calumnies upon her to be false; and Poleme was prevailed upon, and that chiefly on account of her riches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yet did not this matrimony endure long; but Bernice left Poleme, and, as was said, with impure intentions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So he forsook at once this matrimony, and the Jewish religion; and, at the same time, Mariamne put away Archelaus, and was married to Demetrius, the principal man among the Alexandrian Jews, both for his family and his wealth; and indeed he was then their alabarch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So she named her son whom she had by him Agrippinus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But of all these particulars we shall hereafter treat more exactly <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_16">[<a id="_footnoteref_16" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_16" title="View footnote.">16</a>]</sup>.</p>

Concerning The Robbers, Murderers And Impostors, That Arose While Felix And Festus Were Procurators Of Judea.</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">1</div>
<p>Now Claudius Cæsar died when he had reigned thirteen years, eight months, and twenty days; <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_17">[<a id="_footnoteref_17" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_17" title="View footnote.">17</a>]</sup> and a report went about that he was poisoned by his wife Agrippina.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Her father was Germanicus, the brother of Cæsar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Her husband was Domitius Aenobarbus, one of the most illustrious persons that was in the city of Rome; after whose death, and her long continuance in widowhood, Claudius took her to wife.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>She brought along with her a son, Domtitus, of the same name with his father.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He had before this slain his wife Messalina, out of jealousy, by whom he had his children Britannicus and Octavia; their eldest sister was Antonia, whom he had by Pelina his first wife.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He also married Octavia to Nero; for that was the name that Cæsar gave him afterward, upon his adopting him for his son.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">2</div>
<p>But now Agrippina was afraid, lest, when Britannicus should come to man&#8217;s estate, he should succeed his father in the government, and desired to seize upon the principality beforehand for her own son [Nero]; upon which the report went that she thence compassed the death of Claudius.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accordingly, she sent Burrhus, the general of the army, immediately, and with him the tribunes, and such also of the freed-men as were of the greatest authority, to bring Nero away into the camp, and to salute him emperor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And when Nero had thus obtained the government, he got Britannicus to be so poisoned, that the multitude should not perceive it; although he publicly put his own mother to death not long afterward, making her this requital, not only for being born of her, but for bringing it so about by her contrivances that he obtained the Roman empire.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He also slew Octavia his own wife, and many other illustrious persons, under this pretense, that they plotted against him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">3</div>
<p>But I omit any further discourse about these affairs; for there have been a great many who have composed the history of Nero; some of which have departed from the truth of facts out of favor, as having received benefits from him; while others, out of hatred to him, and the great ill-will which they bare him, have so impudently raved against him with their lies, that they justly deserve to be condemned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nor do I wonder at such as have told lies of Nero, since they have not in their writings preserved the truth of history as to those facts that were earlier than his time, even when the actors could have no way incurred their hatred, since those writers lived a long time after them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But as to those that have no regard to truth, they may write as they please; for in that they take delight: but as to ourselves, who have made truth our direct aim, we shall briefly touch upon what only belongs remotely to this undertaking, but shall relate what hath happened to us Jews with great accuracy, and shall not grudge our pains in giving an account both of the calamities we have suffered, and of the crimes we have been guilty of.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I will now therefore return to the relation of our own affairs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">4</div>
<p>For in the first year of the reign of Nero, upon the death of Azizus, king of Emesa, Soemus, his brother, succeeded in his kingdom, and Aristobulus, the son of Herod, king of Chalcis, was intrusted by Nero with the government of the Lesser Armenia.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cæsar also bestowed on Agrippa a certain part of Galilee, Tiberias, and Tarichae, <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_18">[<a id="_footnoteref_18" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_18" title="View footnote.">18</a>]</sup> and ordered them to submit to his jurisdiction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He gave him also Julias, a city of Perea, with fourteen villages that lay about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">5</div>
<p>Now as for the affairs of the Jews, they grew worse and worse continually, for the country was again filled with robbers and impostors, who deluded the multitude.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yet did Felix catch and put to death many of those impostors every day, together with the robbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He also caught Eleazar, the son of Dineas, who had gotten together a company of robbers; and this he did by treachery; for he gave him assurance that he should suffer no harm, and thereby persuaded him to come to him; but when he came, he bound him, and sent him to Rome.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Felix also bore an ill-will to Jonathan, the high priest, because he frequently gave him admonitions about governing the Jewish affairs better than he did, lest he should himself have complaints made of him by the multitude, since he it was who had desired Cæsar to send him as procurator of Judea.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So Felix contrived a method whereby he might get rid of him, now he was become so continually troublesome to him; for such continual admonitions are grievous to those who are disposed to act unjustly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wherefore Felix persuaded one of Jonathan&#8217;s most faithful friends, a citizen of Jerusalem, whose name was Doras, to bring the robbers upon Jonathan, in order to kill him; and this he did by promising to give him a great deal of money for so doing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Doras complied with the proposal, and contrived matters so, that the robbers might murder him after the following manner: Certain of those robbers went up to the city, as if they were going to worship God, while they had daggers under their garments, and by thus mingling themselves among the multitude they slew Jonathan <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_19">[<a id="_footnoteref_19" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_19" title="View footnote.">19</a>]</sup> and as this murder was never avenged, the robbers went up with the greatest security at the festivals after this time; and having weapons concealed in like manner as before, and mingling themselves among the multitude, they slew certain of their own enemies, and were subservient to other men for money; and slew others, not only in remote parts of the city, but in the temple itself also; for they had the boldness to murder men there, without thinking of the impiety of which they were guilty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And this seems to me to have been the reason why God, out of his hatred of these men&#8217;s wickedness, rejected our city; and as for the temple, he no longer esteemed it sufficiently pure for him to inhabit therein, but brought the Romans upon us, and threw a fire upon the city to purge it; and brought upon us, our wives, and children, slavery, as desirous to make us wiser by our calamities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">6</div>
<p>These works, that were done by the robbers, filled the city with all sorts of impiety.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And now these impostors and deceivers persuaded the multitude to follow them into the wilderness, and pretended that they would exhibit manifest wonders and signs, that should be performed by the providence of God.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And many that were prevailed on by them suffered the punishments of their folly; for Felix brought them back, and then punished them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, there came out of Egypt <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_20">[<a id="_footnoteref_20" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_20" title="View footnote.">20</a>]</sup> about this time to Jerusalem one that said he was a prophet, and advised the multitude of the common people to go along with him to the Mount of Olives, as it was called, which lay over against the city, and at the distance of five furlongs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He said further, that he would show them from hence how, at his command, the walls of Jerusalem would fall down; and he promised them that he would procure them an entrance into the city through those walls, when they were fallen down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now when Felix was informed of these things, he ordered his soldiers to take their weapons, and came against them with a great number of horsemen and footmen from Jerusalem, and attacked the Egyptian and the people that were with him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He also slew four hundred of them, and took two hundred alive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the Egyptian himself escaped out of the fight, but did not appear any more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And again the robbers stirred up the people to make war with the Romans, and said they ought not to obey them at all; and when any persons would not comply with them, they set fire to their villages, and plundered them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">7</div>
<p>And now it was that a great sedition arose between the Jews that inhabited Cæsarea, and the Syrians who dwelt there also, concerning their equal right to the privileges belonging to citizens; for the Jews claimed the pre-eminence, because Herod their king was the builder of Cæsarea, and because he was by birth a Jew.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now the Syrians did not deny what was alleged about Herod; but they said that Cæsarea was formerly called Strato&#8217;s Tower, and that then there was not one Jewish inhabitant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the presidents of that country heard of these disorders, they caught the authors of them on both sides, and tormented them with stripes, and by that means put a stop to the disturbance for a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the Jewish citizens depending on their wealth, and on that account despising the Syrians, reproached them again, and hoped to provoke them by such reproaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the Syrians, though they were inferior in wealth, yet valuing themselves highly on this account, that the greatest part of the Roman soldiers that were there were either of Cæsarea or Sebaste, they also for some time used reproachful language to the Jews also; and thus it was, till at length they came to throwing stones at one another, and several were wounded, and fell on both sides, though still the Jews were the conquerors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But when Felix saw that this quarrel was become a kind of war, he came upon them on the sudden, and desired the Jews to desist; and when they refused so to do, he armed his soldiers, and sent them out upon them, and slew many of them, and took more of them alive, and permitted his soldiers to plunder some of the houses of the citizens, which were full of riches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now those Jews that were more moderate, and of principal dignity among them, were afraid of themselves, and desired of Felix that he would sound a retreat to his soldiers, and spare them for the future, and afford them room for repentance for what they had done; and Felix was prevailed upon to do so.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">8</div>
<p>About this time king Agrippa gave the high priesthood to Ismael, who was the son of Fabi.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And now arose a sedition between the high priests and the principal men of the multitude of Jerusalem; each of which got them a company of the boldest sort of men, and of those that loved innovations about them, and became leaders to them; and when they struggled together, they did it by casting reproachful words against one another, and by throwing stones also.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And there was nobody to reprove them; but these disorders were done after a licentious manner in the city, as if it had no government over it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And such was the impudence <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_21">[<a id="_footnoteref_21" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_21" title="View footnote.">21</a>]</sup> and boldness that had seized on the high priests, that they had the hardiness to send their servants into the threshing-floors, to take away those tithes that were due to the priests, insomuch that it so fell out that the poorest sort of the priests died for want.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To this degree did the violence of the seditious prevail over all right and justice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">9</div>
<p>Now when Porcius Festus was sent as successor to Felix by Nero, the principal of the Jewish inhabitants of Cæsarea went up to Rome to accuse Felix; and he had certainly been brought to punishment, unless Nero had yielded to the importunate solicitations of his brother Pallas, who was at that time had in the greatest honor by him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two of the principal Syrians in Cæsarea persuaded Burrhus, who was Nero&#8217;s tutor, and secretary for his Greek epistles, by giving him a great sum of money, to disannul that equality of the Jewish privileges of citizens which they hitherto enjoyed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So Burrhus, by his solicitations, obtained leave of the emperor that an epistle should be written to that purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This epistle became the occasion of the following miseries that befell our nation; for when the Jews of Cæsarea were informed of the contents of this epistle to the Syrians, they were more disorderly than before, till a war was kindled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">10</div>
<p>Upon Festus&#8217;s coming into Judea, it happened that Judea was afflicted by the robbers, while all the villages were set on fire, and plundered by them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then it was that the sicarii, as they were called, who were robbers, grew numerous.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They made use of small swords, not much different in length from the Persian acinacae, but somewhat crooked, and like the Roman sicae, [or sickles,] as they were called; and from these weapons these robbers got their denomination; and with these weapons they slew a great many; for they mingled themselves among the multitude at their festivals, when they were come up in crowds from all parts to the city to worship God, as we said before, and easily slew those that they had a mind to slay.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They also came frequently upon the villages belonging to their enemies, with their weapons, and plundered them, and set them on fire.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So Festus sent forces, both horsemen and footmen, to fall upon those that had been seduced by a certain impostor, who promised them deliverance and freedom from the miseries they were under, if they would but follow him as far as the wilderness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accordingly, those forces that were sent destroyed both him that had deluded them, and those that were his followers also.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">11</div>
<p>About the same time king Agrippa built himself a very large dining- room in the royal palace at Jerusalem, near to the portico.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now this palace had been erected of old by the children of Asamoneus and was situate upon an elevation, and afforded a most delightful prospect to those that had a mind to take a view of the city, which prospect was desired by the king; and there he could lie down, and eat, and thence observe what was done in the temple; which thing, when the chief men of Jerusalem saw they were very much displeased at it; for it was not agreeable to the institutions of our country or law that what was done in the temple should be viewed by others, especially what belonged to the sacrifices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They therefore erected a wall upon the uppermost building which belonged to the inner court of the temple towards the west, which wall when it was built, did not only intercept the prospect of the dining-room in the palace, but also of the western cloisters that belonged to the outer court of the temple also, where it was that the Romans kept guards for the temple at the festivals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At these doings both king Agrippa, and principally Festus the procurator, were much displeased; and Festus ordered them to pull the wall down again: but the Jews petitioned him to give them leave to send an embassage about this matter to Nero; for they said they could not endure to live if any part of the temple should be demolished; and when Festus had given them leave so to do, they sent ten of their principal men to Nero, as also Ismael the high priest, and Helcias, the keeper of the sacred treasure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And when Nero had heard what they had to say, he not only forgave <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_22">[<a id="_footnoteref_22" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_22" title="View footnote.">22</a>]</sup> them what they had already done, but also gave them leave to let the wall they had built stand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This was granted them in order to gratify Poppea, Nero&#8217;s wife, who was a religious woman, and had requested these favors of Nero, and who gave order to the ten ambassadors to go their way home; but retained Helcias and Ismael as hostages with herself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As soon as the king heard this news, he gave the high priesthood to Joseph, who was called Cabi, the son of Simon, formerly high priest.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_concerning_albinus_under_whose_procuratorship_james_was_slain_as_also_what_edifices_were_built_by_agrippa">9. Concerning Albinus Under Whose Procuratorship James Was Slain; As Also What Edifices Were Built By Agrippa.</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">1</div>
<p>And now Cæsar, upon hearing the death of Festus, sent Albinus into Judea, as procurator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the king deprived Joseph of the high priesthood, and bestowed the succession to that dignity on the son of Ananus, who was also himself called Ananus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now the report goes that this eldest Ananus proved a most fortunate man; for he had five sons who had all performed the office of a high priest to God, and who had himself enjoyed that dignity a long time formerly, which had never happened to any other of our high priests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But this younger Ananus, who, as we have told you already, took the high priesthood, was a bold man in his temper, and very insolent; he was also of the sect of the Sadducees, <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_23">[<a id="_footnoteref_23" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_23" title="View footnote.">23</a>]</sup> who are very rigid in judging offenders, above all the rest of the Jews, as we have already observed; when, therefore, Ananus was of this disposition, he thought he had now a proper opportunity [to exercise his authority].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the sanhedrim of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others, [or, some of his companions]; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned: but as for those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens, and such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws, they disliked what was done; they also sent to the king [Agrippa], desiring him to send to Ananus that he should act so no more, for that what he had already done was not to be justified; nay, some of them went also to meet Albinus, as he was upon his journey from Alexandria, and informed him that it was not lawful for Ananus to assemble a sanhedrim without his consent <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_24">[<a id="_footnoteref_24" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_24" title="View footnote.">24</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whereupon Albinus complied with what they said, and wrote in anger to Ananus, and threatened that he would bring him to punishment for what he had done; on which king Agrippa took the high priesthood from him, when he had ruled but three months, and made Jesus, the son of Damneus, high priest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">2</div>
<p>Now as soon as Albinus was come to the city of Jerusalem, he used all his endeavors and care that the country might be kept in peace, and this by destroying many of the Sicarii.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But as for the high priest, Ananias <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_25">[<a id="_footnoteref_25" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_25" title="View footnote.">25</a>]</sup> he increased in glory every day, and this to a great degree, and had obtained the favor and esteem of the citizens in a signal manner; for he was a great hoarder up of money: he therefore cultivated the friendship of Albinus, and of the high priest [Jesus], by making them presents; he also had servants who were very wicked, who joined themselves to the boldest sort of the people, and went to the thrashing-floors, and took away the tithes that belonged to the priests by violence, and did not refrain from beating such as would not give these tithes to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the other high priests acted in the like manner, as did those his servants, without any one being able to prohibit them; so that [some of the] priests, that of old were wont to be supported with those tithes, died for want of food.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">3</div>
<p>But now the Sicarii went into the city by night, just before the festival, which was now at hand, and took the scribe belonging to the governor of the temple, whose name was Eleazar, who was the son of Ananus [Ananias] the high priest, and bound him, and carried him away with them; after which they sent to Ananias, and said that they would send the scribe to him, if he would persuade Albinus to release ten of those prisoners which he had caught of their party; so Ananias was plainly forced to persuade Albinus, and gained his request of him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This was the beginning of greater calamities; for the robbers perpetually contrived to catch some of Ananias&#8217;s servants; and when they had taken them alive, they would not let them go, till they thereby recovered some of their own Sicarii.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And as they were again become no small number, they grew bold, and were a great affliction to the whole country.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">4</div>
<p>About this time it was that king Agrippa built Cæsarea Philippi larger than it was before, and, in honor of Nero, named it Neronlas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And when he had built a theater at Berytus, with vast expenses, he bestowed on them shows, to be exhibited every year, and spent therein many ten thousand [drachmae]; he also gave the people a largess of corn, and distributed oil among them, and adorned the entire city with statues of his own donation, and with original images made by ancient hands; nay, he almost transferred all that was most ornamental in his own kingdom thither.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This made him more than ordinarily hated by his subjects, because he took those things away that belonged to them to adorn a foreign city.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And now Jesus, the son of Gamaliel, became the successor of Jesus, the son of Damneus, in the high priesthood, which the king had taken from the other; on which account a sedition arose between the high priests, with regard to one another; for they got together bodies of the boldest sort of the people, and frequently came, from reproaches, to throwing of stones at each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But Ananias was too hard for the rest, by his riches, which enabled him to gain those that were most ready to receive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Costobarus also, and Saulus, did themselves get together a multitude of wicked wretches, and this because they were of the royal family; and so they obtained favor among them, because of their kindred to Agrippa; but still they used violence with the people, and were very ready to plunder those that were weaker than themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And from that time it principally came to pass that our city was greatly disordered, and that all things grew worse and worse among us.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">5</div>
<p>But when Albinus heard that Gessius Florus was coming to succeed him, he was desirous to appear to do somewhat that might be grateful to the people of Jerusalem; so he brought out all those prisoners who seemed to him to be most plainly worthy of death, and ordered them to be put to death accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But as to those who had been put into prison on some trifling occasions, he took money of them, and dismissed them; by which means the prisons were indeed emptied, but the country was filled with robbers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">6</div>
<p>Now as many of the Levites, <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_26">[<a id="_footnoteref_26" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_26" title="View footnote.">26</a>]</sup> which is a tribe of ours, as were singers of hymns, persuaded the king to assemble a sanhedrim, and to give them leave to wear linen garments, as well as the priests for they said that this would be a work worthy the times of his government, that he might have a memorial of such a novelty, as being his doing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nor did they fail of obtaining their desire; for the king, with the suffrages of those that came into the sanhedrim, granted the singers of hymns this privilege, that they might lay aside their former garments, and wear such a linen one as they desired; and as a part of this tribe ministered in the temple, he also permitted them to learn those hymns as they had besought him for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now all this was contrary to the laws of our country, which, whenever they have been transgressed, we have never been able to avoid the punishment of such transgressions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">7</div>
<p>And now it was that the temple was finished.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So when the people saw that the workmen were unemployed, who were above eighteen thousand and that they, receiving no wages, were in want because they had earned their bread by their labors about the temple; and while they were unwilling to keep by them the treasures that were there deposited, out of fear of [their being carried away by] the Romans; and while they had a regard to the making provision for the workmen; they had a mind to expend these treasures upon them; for if any one of them did but labor for a single hour, he received his pay immediately; so they persuaded him to rebuild the eastern cloisters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These cloisters belonged to the outer court, and were situated in a deep valley, and had walls that reached four hundred cubits [in length], and were built of square and very white stones, the length of each of which stones was twenty cubits, and their height six cubits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This was the work of king Solomon, <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_27">[<a id="_footnoteref_27" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_27" title="View footnote.">27</a>]</sup> who first of all built the entire temple.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But king Agrippa, who had the care of the temple committed to him by Claudius Cæsar, considering that it is easy to demolish any building, but hard to build it up again, and that it was particularly hard to do it to these cloisters, which would require a considerable time, and great sums of money, he denied the petitioners their request about that matter; but he did not obstruct them when they desired the city might be paved with white stone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He also deprived Jesus, the son of Gamaliel, of the high priesthood, and gave it to Matthias, the son of Theophilus, under whom the Jews' war with the Romans took its beginning.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_an_enumeration_of_the_high_priests">10. An Enumeration Of The High Priests.</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">1</div>
<p>And now I think it proper and agreeable to this history to give an account of our high priests; how they began, who those are which are capable of that dignity, and how many of them there had been at the end of the war.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the first place, therefore, history informs us that Aaron, the brother of Moses, officiated to God as a high priest, and that, after his death, his sons succeeded him immediately; and that this dignity hath been continued down from them all to their posterity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whence it is a custom of our country, that no one should take the high priesthood of God but he who is of the blood of Aaron, while every one that is of another stock, though he were a king, can never obtain that high priesthood.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accordingly, the number of all the high priests from Aaron, of whom we have spoken already, as of the first of them, until Phanas, who was made high priest during the war by the seditious, was eighty-three; of whom thirteen officiated as high priests in the wilderness, from the days of Moses, while the tabernacle was standing, until the people came into Judea, when king Solomon erected the temple to God; for at the first they held the high priesthood till the end of their life, although afterward they had successors while they were alive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now these thirteen, who were the descendants of two of the sons of Aaron, received this dignity by succession, one after another; for their form of government was an aristocracy, and after that a monarchy, and in the third place the government was regal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now the number of years during the rule of these thirteen, from the day when our fathers departed out of Egypt, under Moses their leader, until the building of that temple which king Solomon erected at Jerusalem, were six hundred and twelve.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After those thirteen high priests, eighteen took the high priesthood at Jerusalem, one in succession to another, from the days of king Solomon, until Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, made an expedition against that city, and burnt the temple, and removed our nation into Babylon, and then took Josadek, the high priest, captive; the times of these high priests were four hundred and sixty-six years, six months, and ten days, while the Jews were still under the regal government.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But after the term of seventy years' captivity under the Babylonians, Cyrus, king of Persia, sent the Jews from Babylon to their own land again, and gave them leave to rebuild their temple; at which time Jesus, the son of Josadek, took the high priesthood over the captives when they were returned home.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now he and his posterity, who were in all fifteen, until king Antiochus Eupator, were under a democratical government for four hundred and fourteen years; and then the forementioned Antiochus, and Lysias the general of his army, deprived Onias, who was also called Menelaus, of the high priesthood, and slew him at Berea; and driving away the son [of Onias the third], put Jaeimus into the place of the high priest, one that was indeed of the stock of Aaron, but not of that family of Onias.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On which account Onias, who was the nephew of Onias that was dead, and bore the same name with his father, came into Egypt, and got into the friendship of Ptolemy Philometor, and Cleopatra his wife, and persuaded them to make him the high priest of that temple which he built to God in the prefecture of Heliopolis, and this in imitation of that at Jerusalem; but as for that temple which was built in Egypt, we have spoken of it frequently already.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now when Jacimus had retained the priesthood three years, he died, and there was no one that succeeded him, but the city continued seven years without a high priest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But then the posterity of the sons of Asamoneus, who had the government of the nation conferred upon them, when they had beaten the Macedonians in war, appointed Jonathan to be their high priest, who ruled over them seven years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And when he had been slain by the treacherous contrivance of Trypho, as we have related some where, Simon his brother took the high priesthood; and when he was destroyed at a feast by the treachery of his son-in-law, his own son, whose name was Hyrcanus, succeeded him, after he had held the high priesthood one year longer than his brother.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Hyrcanus enjoyed that dignity thirty years, and died an old man, leaving the succession to Judas, who was also called Aristobulus, whose brother Alexander was his heir; which Judas died of a sore distemper, after he had kept the priesthood, together with the royal authority; for this Judas was the first that put on his head a diadem for one year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And when Alexander had been both king and high priest twenty-seven years, he departed this life, and permitted his wife Alexandra to appoint him that should be high priest; so she gave the high priesthood to Hyrcanus, but retained the kingdom herself nine years, and then departed this life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The like duration [and no longer] did her son Hyrcanus enjoy the high priesthood; for after her death his brother Aristobulus fought against him, and beat him, and deprived him of his principality; and he did himself both reign, and perform the office of high priest to God.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But when he had reigned three years, and as many months, Pompey came upon him, and not only took the city of Jerusalem by force, but put him and his children in bonds, and sent them to Rome.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He also restored the high priesthood to Hyrcanus, and made him governor of the nation, but forbade him to wear a diadem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Hyrcanus ruled, besides his first nine years, twenty-four years more, when Barzapharnes and Pacorus, the generals of the Parthians, passed over Euphrates, and fought with Hyrcanus, and took him alive, and made Antigonus, the son of Aristobulus, king; and when he had reigned three years and three months, Sosius and Herod besieged him, and took him, when Antony had him brought to Antioch, and slain there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Herod was then made king by the Romans, but did no longer appoint high priests out of the family of Asamoneus; but made certain men to be so that were of no eminent families, but barely of those that were priests, excepting that he gave that dignity to Aristobulus; for when he had made this Aristobulus, the grandson of that Hyrcanus who was then taken by the Parthians, and had taken his sister Mariarmne to wife, he thereby aimed to win the good-will of the people, who had a kind remembrance of Hyrcanus [his grandfather].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yet did he afterward, out of his fear lest they should all bend their inclinations to Aristobulus, put him to death, and that by contriving how to have him suffocated as he was swimming at Jericho, as we have already related that matter; but after this man he never intrusted the priesthood to the posterity of the sons of Asamoneus.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Archelaus also, Herod&#8217;s son, did like his father in the appointment of the high priests, as did the Romans also, who took the government over the Jews into their hands afterward.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accordingly, the number of the high priests, from the days of Herod until the day when Titus took the temple and the City, and burnt them, were in all twenty- eight; the time also that belonged to them was a hundred and seven years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of these were the political governors of the people under the reign of Herod, and under the reign of Archelaus his son, although, after their death, the government became an aristocracy, and the high priests were intrusted with a dominion over the nation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And thus much may suffice to be said concerning our high priests.</p>

<h2 id="_concerning_florus_the_procurator_who_necessitated_the_jews_to_take_up_arms_against_the_romans_the_conclusion">11. Concerning Florus The Procurator, Who Necessitated The Jews To Take Up Arms Against The Romans. The Conclusion.</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">1</div>
<p>Now Gessius Florus, who was sent as successor to Albinus by Nero, filled Judea with abundance of miseries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He was by birth of the city of Clazomene, and brought along with him his wife Cleopatra, [by whose friendship with Poppea, Nero&#8217;s wife, he obtained this government,] who was no way different from him in wickedness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Florus was so wicked, and so violent in the use of his authority, that the Jews took Albinus to have been [comparatively] their benefactor; so excessive were the mischiefs that he brought upon them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For Albinus concealed his wickedness, and was careful that it might not be discovered to all men; but Gessius Florus, as though he had been sent on purpose to show his crimes to every body, made a pompous ostentation of them to our nation, as never omitting any sort of violence, nor any unjust sort of punishment; for he was not to be moved by pity, and never was satisfied with any degree of gain that came in his way; nor had he any more regard to great than to small acquisitions, but became a partner with the robbers themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a great many fell then into that practice without fear, as having him for their security, and depending on him, that he would save them harmless in their particular robberies; so that there were no bounds set to the nation&#8217;s miseries; but the unhappy Jews, when they were not able to bear the devastations which the robbers made among them, were all under a necessity of leaving their own habitations, and of flying away, as hoping to dwell more easily any where else in the world among foreigners [than in their own country].</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And what need I say any more upon this head? since it was this Florus who necessitated us to take up arms against the Romans, while we thought it better to be destroyed at once, than by little and little.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now this war began in the second year of the government of Florus, and the twelfth year of the reign of Nero.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But then what actions we were forced to do, or what miseries we were enabled to suffer, may be accurately known by such as will peruse those books which I have written about the Jewish war.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">2</div>
<p>I shall now, therefore, make an end here of my Antiquities; after the conclusion of which events, I began to write that account of the war; and these Antiquities contain what hath been delivered down to us from the original creation of man, until the twelfth year of the reign of Nero, as to what hath befallen the Jews, as well in Egypt as in Syria and in Palestine, and what we have suffered from the Assyrians and Babylonians, and what afflictions the Persians and Macedonians, and after them the Romans, have brought upon us; for I think I may say that I have composed this history with sufficient accuracy in all things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have attempted to enumerate those high priests that we have had during the interval of two thousand years; I have also carried down the succession of our kings, and related their actions, and political administration, without [considerable] errors, as also the power of our monarchs; and all according to what is written in our sacred books; for this it was that I promised to do in the beginning of this history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And I am so bold as to say, now I have so completely perfected the work I proposed to myself to do, that no other person, whether he were a Jew or foreigner, had he ever so great an inclination to it, could so accurately deliver these accounts to the Greeks as is done in these books.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For those of my own nation freely acknowledge that I far exceed them in the learning belonging to Jews; I have also taken a great deal of pains to obtain the learning of the Greeks, and understand the elements of the Greek language, although I have so long accustomed myself to speak our own tongue, that I cannot pronounce Greek with sufficient exactness; for our nation does not encourage those that learn the languages of many nations, and so adorn their discourses with the smoothness of their periods; because they look upon this sort of accomplishment as common, not only to all sorts of free-men, but to as many of the servants as please to learn them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But they give him the testimony of being a wise man who is fully acquainted with our laws, and is able to interpret their meaning; on which account, as there have been many who have done their endeavors with great patience to obtain this learning, there have yet hardly been so many as two or three that have succeeded therein, who were immediately well rewarded for their pains.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">3</div>
<p>And now it will not be perhaps an invidious thing, if I treat briefly of my own family, and of the actions of my own life <sup class="footnote" id="_footnote_28">[<a id="_footnoteref_28" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_28" title="View footnote.">28</a>]</sup> while there are still living such as can either prove what I say to be false, or can attest that it is true; with which accounts I shall put an end to these Antiquities, which are contained in twenty books, and sixty thousand verses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And if God permit me, I will briefly run over this war 29, and to add what befell them further to that very day, the 13th of Domitian, or A.D.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>03, is not, that I have observed, taken distinct notice of by any one; nor do we ever again, with what befell us therein to this very day, which is the thirteenth year of the reign of Cæsar Domitian, and the fifty-sixth year of my own life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have also an intention to write three books concerning our Jewish opinions about God and his essence, and about our laws; why, according to them, some things are permitted us to do, and others are prohibited.</p>
</div>

<a href="#_footnoteref_1">1</a>. Here is some error in the copies, or mistake in Josephus; for the power of appointing high priests, alter Herod king of Chalcis was dead, and Agrippa, junior, was made king of Chalcis in his room, belonged to him; and he exercised the same all along till Jerusalem was destroyed, as Josephus elsewhere informs us, ch. 8. sect., 11; ch. 9. sect. 1, 4, 6, 7.

<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_4">
<a href="#_footnoteref_4">4</a>. Josephus is very full and express in these three chapters, 3., 4., and 5., in observing how carefully Divine Providence preserved this Izates, king of Adiabene, and his sons, while he did what he thought was his bounden duty, notwithstanding the strongest political motives to the contrary.
</div>
<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_5">
<a href="#_footnoteref_5">5</a>. This further account of the benefactions of Izates and Helena to the Jerusalem Jews which Josephus here promises is, I think, no where performed by him in his present works. But of this terrible famine itself in Judea, take Dr. Hudson&#8217;s note here:--"This ( says he ) is that famine foretold by Agabus, Acts 11:28, which happened when Claudius was consul the fourth time; and not that other which happened when Claudius was consul the second time, and Cesina was his colleague, as Scaliger says upon Eusebius, p. 174." Now when Josephus had said a little afterward, ch. 5. sect. 2, that "Tiberius Alexander succeeded Cuspius Fadus as procurator," he immediately subjoins, that" under these procurators there happened a great famine in Judea." Whence it is plain that this famine continued for many years, on account of its duration under these two procurators. Now Fadus was not sent into Judea till after the death of king Agrippa, i.e. towards the latter end of the 4th year of Claudius; so that this famine foretold by Agabus happened upon the 5th, 6th, and 7th years of Claudius, as says Valesius on Euseb. II. 12. Of this famine also, and queen Helena&#8217;s supplies, and her monument, see Moses Churenensis, p. 144, 145, where it is observed in the notes that Pausanias mentions that her monument also.

<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_7">
<a href="#_footnoteref_7">7</a>. This conduct of Izates is a sign that he was become either a Jew, or an Ebionite Christian, who indeed differed not much from proper Jews. See ch. 6. sect. 1. However, his supplications were heard, and he was providentially delivered from that imminent danger he was in.

<a href="#_footnoteref_8">8</a>. These pyramids or pillars, erected by Helena, queen of Adiabene, near Jerusalem, three in number, are mentioned by Eusebius, in his Eccles. Hist. B. II. ch. 12, for which Dr. Hudson refers us to Valesius&#8217;s notes upon that place.--They are also mentioned by Pausanias, as hath been already noted, ch. 2. sect. 6. Reland guesses that that now called Absalom&#8217;s Pillar may be one of them.

<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_10">
<a href="#_footnoteref_10">10</a>. This and many more tumults and seditions which arose at the Jewish festivals, in Josephus, illustrate the cautious procedure of the Jewish governors, when they said, Matthew 26:5, "Let us not take Jesus on the feast-day, lest there be an up roar among the people;" as Reland well observes on tins place. Josephus also takes notice of the same thing, Of the War, B. I. ch. 4. sect. 3.

<a href="#_footnoteref_11">11</a>. This constant passage of the Galileans through the country of Samaria, as they went to Judea and Jerusalem, illustrates several passages in the Gospels to the same purpose, as Dr. Hudson rightly observes. See Luke 17:11; John 4:4. See also Josephus in his own Life, sect. 52, where that journey is determined to three days.

<a href="#_footnoteref_12">12</a>. Our Savior had foretold that the Jews' rejection of his gospel would bring upon them, among other miseries, these three, which they themselves here show they expected would be the consequences of their present tumults and seditions: the utter subversion of their country, the conflagration of their temple, and the slavery of themselves, their wives, and children See Luke 21:6-24.
</div>
<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_13">
<a href="#_footnoteref_13">13</a>. This Simon, a friend of Felix, a Jew, born in Cyprus, though he pretended to be a magician, and seems to have been wicked enough, could hardly be that famous Simon the magician, in the Acts of the Apostles, 8:9, etc., as some are ready to suppose. This Simon mentioned in the Acts was not properly a Jew, but a Samaritan, of the town of Gittae, in the country of Samaria, as the Apostolical Constitutions, VI. 7, the Recognitions of Clement, II. 6, and Justin Martyr, himself born in the country of Samaria, Apology, I. 34, inform us. He was also the author, not of any ancient Jewish, but of the first Gentile heresies, as the forementioned authors assure us. So I suppose him a different person from the other. I mean this only upon the hypothesis that Josephus was not misinformed as to his being a Cypriot Jew; for otherwise the time, the name, the profession, and the wickedness of them both would strongly incline one to believe them the very same. As to that Drusilla, the sister of Agrippa, junior, as Josephus informs us here, and a Jewess, as St. Luke informs us, Acts 24:24, whom this Simon mentioned by Josephus persuaded to leave her former husband, Azizus, king of Emesa, a proselyte of justice, and to marry Felix, the heathen procurator of Judea, Tacitus, Hist. V. 9, supposes her to be a heathen; and the grand-daughter of Antonius and Cleopatra, contrary both to St. Luke and Josephus. Now Tacitus lived somewhat too remote, both as to time and place, to be compared with either of those Jewish writers, in a matter concerning the Jews in Judea in their own days, and concerning a sister of Agrippa, junior, with which Agrippa Josephus was himself so well acquainted. It is probable that Tacitus may say true, when he informs us that this Felix (who had in all three wives, or queens, as Suetonius in Claudius, sect. 28, assures us) did once marry such a grandchild of Antonius and Cleopatra; and finding the name of one of them to have been Drusilla, he mistook her for that other wife, whose name he did not know.

See Bianchini&#8217;s curious and important observations on this Vesuvius, and its seven several great eruptions, with their remains vitrified, and still existing, in so many different strata under ground, till the diggers came to the antediluvian waters, with their proportionable interstices, implying the deluge to have been above two thousand five hundred years before the Christian era, according to our exactest chronology.

Domitius Aenobarbus, after Claudius had adopted him was Nero Claudius Cæsar Drusus Germanicus. This Soleus as (own Life, sect. 11, as also) by Dio Cassius and Taeims, as Dr. Hudson informs us.

<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_19">
<a href="#_footnoteref_19">19</a>. This treacherous and barbarous murder of the good high priest Jonathan, by the contrivance of this wicked procurator, Felix, was the immediate occasion of the ensuing murders by the Sicarii or ruffians, and one great cause of the following horrid cruelties and miseries of the Jewish nation, as Josephus here supposes; whose excellent reflection on the gross wickedness of that nation, as the direct cause of their terrible destruction, is well worthy the attention of every Jewish and of every Christian reader. And since we are soon coming to the catalogue of the Jewish high priests, it may not be amiss, with Reland, to insert this Jonathan among them, and to transcribe his particular catalogue of the last twenty-eight high priests, taken out of Josephus, and begin with Ananelus, who was made by Herod the Great. See Antiq. B. XV. ch. 2. sect. 4, and the note there. 1. Ananelus. 2. Aristobulus. 3. Jesus, the son of Fabus. 4. Simon, the son of Boethus. 5. Marthias, the son of Theophiltu. 6. Joazar, the son of Boethus. 7. Eleazar, the son of Boethus. 8. Jesus, the son of Sic. 9. (Annas, or) Ananus, the son of Seth. 10. Ismael, the son of Fabus. 11. Eleazar, the son of Ananus. 12. Simon, the son of Camithus. 13. Josephus Caiaphas, the son-in-law to Ananus. 14. Jonathan, the son of Ananus. 15. Theophilus, his brother, and son of Ananus. 16. Simon, the son of Boethus. 17. Matthias, the brother of Jonathan, and son of Ananus. 18. Aljoneus. 19. Josephus, the son of Camydus. 20. Ananias, the son of Nebedeus. 21. Jonathas. 22. Ismael, the son of Fabi. 23. Joseph Cabi, the son of Simon. 24. Ananus, the son of Artanus. 25. Jesus, the son of Damnetas. 26. Jesus, the son of Gamaliel. 27. Matthias, the son of Theophilus. 28. Phannias, the son of Samuel. As for Ananus and Joseph Caiaphas, here mentioned about the middle of this catalogue, they are no other than those Annas and Caiaphas so often mentioned in the four Gospels; and that Ananias, the son of Nebedeus, was that high priest before whom St. Paul pleaded his own cause, Acts 24.

<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_21">
<a href="#_footnoteref_21">21</a>. The wickedness here was very peculiar and extraordinary, that the high priests should so oppress their brethren the priests, as to starve the poorest of them to death. See the like presently, ch. 9. sect. 2. Such fatal crimes are covetousness and tyranny in the clergy, as well as in the laity, in all ages.

We have here one eminent example of Nero&#8217;s mildness and goodness in his government towards the Jews, during the first five years of his reign, so famous in antiquity; we have perhaps another in Josephus&#8217;s own Life, sect. 3; and a third, though of a very different nature here, in sect. 9, just before. However, both the generous acts of kindness were obtained of Nero by his queen Poppea, who was a religious lady, and perhaps privately a Jewish proselyte, and so were not owing entirely to Nero&#8217;s own goodness.

<a href="#_footnoteref_23">23</a>. It hence evidently appears that Sadducees might be high priests in the days of Josephus, and that these Sadducees were usually very severe and inexorable judges, while the Pharisees were much milder, and more merciful, as appears by Reland&#8217;s instances in his note on this place, and on Josephus&#8217;s Life, sect. 31, and those taken from the New Testament, from Josephus himself, and from the Rabbins; nor do we meet with any Sadducees later than this high priest in all Josephus.

The sanhedrim condemned our Savior, but could not put him to death without the approbation of the Roman procurator; nor could therefore Ananias and his sanhedrim do more here, since they never had Albinus&#8217;s approbation for the putting this James to death.
</div>
<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_25">
<a href="#_footnoteref_25">25</a>. This Ananias was not the son of Nebedeus, as I take it, but he who was called Annas or Ananus the elder, the ninth in the catalogue, and who had been esteemed high priest for a long time; and, besides Caiaphas, his son-in-law, had five of his own sons high priests after him, which were those of numbers 11, 14, 15, 17, 24, in the foregoing catalogue. Nor ought we to pass slightly over what Josephus here says of Annas, or Ananias, that he was high priest a long time before his children were so; he was the son of Seth, and is set down first for high priest in the foregoing catalogue, under number 9. He was made by Quirinus, and continued till Ismael, the 10th in number, for about twenty-three years, which long duration of his high priesthood, joined to the successions of his son-in-law, and five children of his own, made him a sort of perpetual high priest, and was perhaps the occasion that former high priests kept their titles ever afterwards; for I believe it is hardly met with be fore him.

<a href="#_footnoteref_26">26</a>. This insolent petition of some of the Levites, to wear the sacerdotal garments when they sung hymns to God in the temple, was very probably owing to the great depression and contempt the haughty high priests had now brought their brethren the priests into; of which see ch. 8. sect. 8, and ch. 9, sect. 2.
